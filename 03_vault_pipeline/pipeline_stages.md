# Pipeline Stages  
*Governed execution model for the Vault Pipeline*

The pipeline consists of five governed stages:

---

## 1. Capture
Raw material enters the system.  
Must comply with **capture_contract.yaml**.

---

## 2. Normalization
Signals are cleaned, decomposed, and drift-mapped.  
Vara integration is mandatory.

---

## 3. Structuring
Artifacts are shaped into governed structures.  
Stumpy integration is mandatory.

---

## 4. Coherence Check
Artifacts must pass:

- structural integrity  
- constraint compliance  
- drift thresholds  
- reversibility checks  

---

## 5. Vault Handoff
Artifacts are delivered to the Vault.  
Must comply with **vault_handoff_contract.yaml**.

This stage is governed by:

- Ω‑13 (Bilateralism)  
- Vault Lifecycle Rules  
- Operator Playbook Section 7
